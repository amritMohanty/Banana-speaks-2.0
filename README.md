# Banana-speaks-2.0
## This is practice of @tanayPratap's live lesson-4 of interacting with javascript and creating something fun.
-  ## Notes from Live session.
    ### Things covered regarding project
    -   attaching events to HTML elements
    -   taking input in the browser
    -   using `querySelector()`
    -   showing output in the browser
    -   Making network calls to get relevant date
    -   Error handling network calls 
### Steps i took:-
                - Installed Postman for testing API call

### Basic steps:-
    1. Setting up Index.html and commit
    2. Two ways of putting in script tag
    3. Alert(out) and Prompt(inp) for inp/out
    4. Using querySelector for wiring the button to event listener and return "clicked" on console
    5.






### Sidenotes:-
    - since the javascript get interpreted and compiled top to bottom, we should put script file just before ending the body tag.
    - after `33.30` he explains how to get reference for btn-translate in JS file.
        - here querySelector is used and assigned to a variable
