# Banana-speaks-2.0
## This is practice of @tanayPratap's live lesson-4 of interacting with javascript and creating something fun.
-  ## Notes from Live session.
    ### Things covered regarding project
    -   attaching events to HTML elements
    -   taking input in the browser
    -   using `querySelector()`
    -   showing output in the browser
    -   Making network calls to get relevant date
    -   Error handling network calls 
### Steps i took:-
    -   Installed Postman for testing API call

### Basic steps:-
    1. Setting up Index.html and commit
    2. Two ways of putting in script tag
    3. Alert(out) and Prompt(inp) for inp/out
    4. Using querySelector for wiring the button to event listener and return "clicked" on console
    5.



### Sidenotes:-
    - since the javascript get interpreted and compiled top to bottom, we should put script file just before ending the body tag.
    - after `33.30` he explains how to get reference for btn-translate in JS file.
        - here querySelector is used and assigned to a variable
        - next is to listen to an event, for interaction btwn users and application. ways of interaction are scroll, click ,touch etc.
            - `addEventListener("user_action, callback function)`
                - ** callback function is essentially the consequence of the given browser event such as click or touch. **
            - `document` is an api!?! research on this
            -  add a text area and add padding, make the displayh into a block
            -  **.value works for forms and input based elements and query selectors work on the css selectors(for first argument)**, next follow live exercise
                - textarea'
                - #input-btn
                - .btn
                - input[name='translator']
